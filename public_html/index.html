        <!-- Add a paragraph element that includes a summary about how to plan a website -->
        <p>
            To plan a website, I first need to identify the purpose of the 
            website and the goals of the business to help shape the design and 
            type of website I'm developing. I need to understand who my target
            audience is, create a wire frame sketch for my web pages, and 
            ensure that my site is responsive and accessible.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Add a paragraph element with 1 or 2 sentences about what I learned in Chapter 1 -->
        <p>
            One thing I learned in Chapter 1 is the difference between an 
            element and an attribute. Elements consist of everything from the 
            start tag to the end tag, including content, and represents a 
            distinct part of a webpage such as a paragraph or heading. An 
            attribute defines additional characteristics, or properties, 
            of the element such as the width and height of an image.
